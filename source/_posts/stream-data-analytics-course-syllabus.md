## Objective

Stream Data Analytics Course (sdac) aims to provide students with a practical understanding of statistical and mining problems and challenges on data streams, in comparison with the offline statistics and machine learning.

## Target Audience
Students learning sdac should be comfortable with simple mathematics, statistics, and programming. Previous experience in programming is not mandatory but better to have. Those who do not have previous programming experience should expect to spend additional time studying and learning to be familiar with a programming language during the coursework.
